Arma2NET
========

Arma2NET gives you the ability to use the Microsoft .NET Framework from SQF script code in RV engine games. It is designed to be an alternative for those who don't want to use C or C++ with callExtension.

There is a wide range of language implementations that target the Common Language Runtime, so you can potentially use C#, Python, VB.NET, F#, Ruby and more from SQF.
